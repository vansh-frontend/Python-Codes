### Modules and PIP

Modules: is like a library can be used to borrow the code written by somebody
else in your python program

2 types of Modules are:
(1) built in - these are ready to import and use and ships with python
interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicity

(2) external modules - these modules are imported from a third party file or can be 
installed using package manager like pip or conda.since is written by someone else
we can install diffrent version of a same module with the time.
